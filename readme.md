# RGB Game

* A  RGB value will be displayed at the top of the page. A set of random colors will be displayed below that with one being the RGB value given to you. You must find the color
that corresponds with the RGB value and click it. An RGB color value is specified with: rgb(red, green, blue). Each parameter (red, green, blue) defines the intensity of
the color as an integer between 0 and 255. For example, rgb(0, 0, 255) is rendered as blue, because the blue parameter is set to its highest value (255) and the others are
set to 0. Click [RGB Color Model Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model) for more information on RGB.
